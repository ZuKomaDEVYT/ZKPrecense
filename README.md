## What is ZKPrecense
**ZKPresence** is a plugin developed by [ZKGames](https://www.roblox.com/communities/33688157/ZKGames) (actually, I just uploaded it there; it was made by me ZuKomaDEV :3). This plugin allows you to connect **RobloxStudio with Discord**, allowing you to show what you're working on, the game's visuals, how many collaborators you have, and let people try out your experience, among many other things.

But of course, if there are already several plugins that do this, why use **ZKPresence**? This is because this plugin allows you to do many things that other plugins offer separately... CUSTOMIZATION

You can customize everything, such as:
- The description when you are in a ModuleScript, Script, LocalScript, in the workspace, or, what I like most, ANIMATING
- Whether or not to show the collaborators who are with you in the experience
- Activate the "Play My Game" button, which allows those who view your RPC to try your experience
- Add an extra button for whatever you want (I'm not responsible for what they put :3)
- Make the game image appear instead of the RobloxStudio image
- Add a Sub State when you are in the workspace
- Disable the plugin independently in case you have multiple RobloxStudios at the same time
- Show or not the game image
- And the most useless thing is to move the customization window (sometimes it doesn't work, and don't even ask me why :'<)

If you want to modify the source code, it can be modified in: https://github.com/ZuKomaDEVYT/RPCStudio-By-ZuKomaDEV

I hope you like the plugin too. It was made in 3 weeks, so keep that in mind...
